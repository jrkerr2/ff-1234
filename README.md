## Heroku deploy: https://dry-headland-82171.herokuapp.com/

# Description
    ## This is an application designed to match the user with another friend in a "database". This "databse"
    ## is really an array of objects in a javascript file used for testing. Extending the app to real world 
    ## functionality would probably require a real database (RDBMS, NoSQL, Firebase, etc.). This deployed 
    ## application (Heroku deploy: https://dry-headland-82171.herokuapp.com/) uses Express and Node on the 
    ## server side, HTML & jQuery on the client (browser) side, and does some simple math calculations using
    ## user survey inputs to find a friend match.

# Installation
    ## No installation required; access app through the Heroku platform
    ## https://dry-headland-82171.herokuapp.com/

# Source code
    ## you can look at my code here:

# Technical Debt
    ## There are LOTS of improvements needed for a real-world application (data validation, upload 
    ## functionality to remove pathing issues, real database implmention, etc.)
    ## defect where the image is not rendered in the popped modal on Submit (works locally)
    ## styling improvements needed for the modal
    ## styling improvements needed for the home and survey pages
    ## debugging comments still exist on server and client side
    ## better comments in code are needed for maintenance
